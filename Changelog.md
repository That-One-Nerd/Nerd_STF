# Nerd_STF v2.1.2

This update just replaces instances of `double` with `float` instead.

I know, this isn't the update you wanted. More stuff coming soon.

```
* Nerd_STF
    = Replace all instances of `double` with `float`
    * Mathematics
        = Renamed `Double2` to `Float2`
        = Renamed `Double3` to `Float3`
        = Renamed `Double4` to `Float4`
```
