    <PackageReleaseNotes>A bunch of stuff has changed, hasn't it?

This update was originally intended to be a support update. But among other problems, I don't want to maintain 3 slightly different versions of Nerd_STF at the same time. So I'm going to put the support update on hold for now. I won't delete my progress on it (I got about a quarter of the way done with support for .NET Standard 2.0. It's a big undertaking), I won't promise any completion date either.

Instead, this update ended up being a quality-of-life update. I already finished this part of the update before I decided to cancel the support update. This update now has lots of support for the new .NET 7 features. I'm now using a bunch of static abstract interfaces. I also added range indexing to almost all of the types available. The color byte types now have int fields instead of byte fields because ints are much more common. The values are automatically clamped between 0 and 255 just in case. Basically all types are records now because records are really nice. Lastly, some stuff has been marked as deprecated and to be removed in a future release because they already, exist, are kind of useless, and/or are misleading. Most of the deprecated stuff will be removed in either 2.4.0 or 2.5.0.

Also, just want to note that despite the Vert`struct not being marked as deprecated, it will still be removed in 2.5.0. I didn't mark it because that would have created a bunch of warnings in my library. And I don't like warnings.

One final note, I've changed the description of the library and I've changed a bunch of the assembly and compilation settings.

Anyway, that's it for this update. The longest delay was just getting this project to other versions of .NET. Stay tuned for v2.4.0, the Equations and Numbers update!</PackageReleaseNotes>
