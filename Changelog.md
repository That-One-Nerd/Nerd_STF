# Nerd_STF v2.1.1

This update doesn't add any new features, simply a code simplification, using some of the .net 6 tools, such as global usings and file-scoped namespace declarations.

```
* Nerd_STF
    = Removed unused or unrequired usings in all files.
    = Replaced all namespace declarations with file-scoped declarations.
    * Miscellaneous
        * GlobalUsings
            + global using System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis
```
